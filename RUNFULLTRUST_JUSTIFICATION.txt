VoiKy converts speech to text and types it into any active application. runFullTrust is required because:

1. The app must inject keyboard input across process boundaries to type into other applications (browsers, editors, etc.)
2. Uses Python 'keyboard' library for system-wide keystroke simulation
3. UWP sandbox prevents cross-application keyboard injection

Without runFullTrust, VoiKy cannot perform its core function of typing recognized speech into other apps.
